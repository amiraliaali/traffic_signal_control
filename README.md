## Repository Overview
This repository applies various Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms to solve a maze problem. The objective, as shown in the GIFs above, is for the agent to find the shortest path from the start to the coins.

In this repository we have implemented the Reinforcement Learning Deep SARSA algorithm for training an agent to efficiently control traffic lights of a junction.
